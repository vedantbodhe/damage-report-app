Report My Damage!

Report My Damage! is a fast, serverless-ready web application that enables users to submit package damage reports via image uploads. Leveraging AWS services (S3, Rekognition, Textract, SES) and OpenAI Vision, it automates damage classification and optional email notifications to package senders. The app features a modern TailwindCSS-powered frontend and is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a CI/CD pipeline.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Damage Classification: Uses OpenAI Vision (GPT-4 Vision) to classify package damage into categories: scratch, tear, break, dent, or other.
	‚Ä¢	Barcode Processing: (Optional) Scan barcode labels via AWS Rekognition or OpenAI Vision to extract shipment metadata.
	‚Ä¢	OCR Extraction: (Optional) Use AWS Textract to extract text (e.g., email addresses) when notifying senders.
	‚Ä¢	Email Notifications: Send rich HTML email reports with inline images via AWS SES.
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: Responsive, TailwindCSS-based UI with professional branding and user-friendly forms.
	‚Ä¢	Health Checks: Built-in root and /health endpoints for AWS ELB health monitoring.
	‚Ä¢	CI/CD: Integrated GitHub Actions for SAST (CodeQL), secrets scanning (Gitleaks), and automated Elastic Beanstalk deployments.
