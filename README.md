# Report My Damage!

https://www.reportmydamage.com (currently disabled)

Report My Damage! is a fast, serverless-ready web application that enables users to submit package damage reports via image uploads. Leveraging AWS services (S3, Rekognition, Textract, SES) and OpenAI Vision, it automates damage classification and optional email notifications to package senders. The app features a modern TailwindCSS-powered frontend and is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a CI/CD pipeline.

üöÄ Features

 - Damage Classification: Uses OpenAI Vision (GPT-4 Vision) to
   classify package damage into categories: scratch, tear, break, dent,
   or other. 
   
 - Barcode Processing: (Optional) Scan barcode labels via
   AWS Rekognition or OpenAI Vision to extract shipment metadata. 	
 - Email Notifications: Send rich
   HTML email reports with inline images via AWS SES. 	
 - Frontend: Responsive, TailwindCSS-based UI with professional branding and
   user-friendly forms. 	
 - Health Checks: Built-in root and /health
   endpoints for AWS ELB health monitoring. 	
   
 - CI/CD: Integrated GitHub Actions for SAST (CodeQL) and secrets scanning (Gitleaks).

   
 - OCR Extraction: (Work in Progress) Use AWS Textract to extract text (e.g., email
   addresses) when notifying senders.
